                        <p>I have acquired many valuable skills through my diverse work experiences as a car wash and construction worker, missionary, and metal worker. These include a strong work ethic, problem-solving skills, and the ability to adapt quickly to new environments. In addition, my experience as a missionary taught me the importance of communication and collaboration. At the same time, my time as a metal worker allowed me to develop technical skills and attention to detail. My varied experiences have given me a unique talent set that can be applied to any new challenge or opportunity.</p>
